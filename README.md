### Why it's Useful

The application is highly valuable as it enables individuals without SQL knowledge to effortlessly query the database using natural language. In this specific use case, consider a scenario where we have customer data, including the probability of purchase. A marketing professional can use plain English to query for customers with the highest likelihood of making a purchase. This intuitive approach empowers marketing teams to make data-driven decisions and target high-probability customer segments effectively. With real-time insights at their fingertips, marketers can focus on converting potential leads with ease and efficiency.

### Technology Stack

The project leverages the following technologies:

- Python: The primary programming language used for developing the application.
- Streamlit: A user-friendly web framework for creating interactive data apps, serving as the user interface.
- OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo: The advanced NLP language model used for transforming natural language prompts into SQL queries.
- SQLAlchemy: A powerful SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) utilized for database connections.

### Getting Started

To launch the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
4. Run the following command:
